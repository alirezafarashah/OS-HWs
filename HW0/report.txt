HW0 ReportAlireza Dehghanpour 98101555References of each part are mentioned at the end of this file.I used my system. The properties of it is mentioned below.Edition	Windows 11 HomeVersion	21H2Installed on	‎12/‎18/‎2021OS build	22000.493Experience	Windows Feature Experience Pack 1000.22000.493.01)After installing vagrant and vbox terminal commands needed to be run. First problem was connection timeout in "vagrant up". After some search in guthub I found that there is a problem with WSL2 and vagrant so I disables this feature in my windows features tool.After that there was no problem with this part. 3)3.1For this coding part is used Clion for editing codes. I used SSH config of vagrant for making connection and Clion terminal as VM terminal.3.2In this part I read descriptions from "man getrlimit". I print soft limit resource which its definition is: "The soft limit is the value that the kernel enforces for the corresponding resource.  The hard limit acts as a ceiling for the soft limit: an unprivileged process  may  set only  its  soft  limit  to  a  value  in  the  range  from 0 up to the hard limit, and (irreversibly) lower its hard limit."3.3For learning gdb I used refrences links which I mentioned in last part of this report.3.4For answering this part I used diffrent links but the main one was about objdump.http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/en/man1/objdump.1.htmlrefrences:1https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/119873.2https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/get-set-process-resource-limits-in-c/3.3https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWH-nL7v5F4https://sourceware.org/gdb/download/onlinedocs/gdb/Continuing-and-Stepping.htmlhttps://www.irya.unam.mx/computo/sites/manuales/fce12/debugger/cl/commandref/gdb_modeconditional breakpointhttps://undo.io/resources/gdb-watchpoint/conditional-breakpoints/3.4http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/en/man1/objdump.1.htmlhttps://downloads.ti.com/docs/esd/SPRU513/introduction-to-sections-stdz0691509.htmlhttps://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/binutils/objdump.html
